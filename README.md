# DNA Promoter Classification

This project classifies promoter vs. non-promoter regions in the human genome using machine learning.

## üß¨ Dataset

- Extracted from human chromosome 1 (`chr1.fa`)
- 1000 promoter sequences (200 bp upstream of gene start)
- 1000 non-promoter sequences (200 bp random from non-promoter regions)
- Final dataset: `Data/labeled_sequences.csv`

## üîß Tools Used

- `bedtools`, `awk` for data extraction
- `Biopython` for FASTA parsing
- Python + scikit-learn or PyTorch/TensorFlow (upcoming)
